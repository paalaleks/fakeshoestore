A simple overview of the use/purpose of the project.

## Description

This project was a semester project where we went through a alot of different methods to build webpages(webapps). This one is made with Parcel.js. When you build with parcel you'll get a better a idea of how webpages work , casue you "go under the hood" of a bundler. Although webpack is the most common one, parcel bundles together in a smiliar way.
