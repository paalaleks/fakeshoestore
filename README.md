## Description

This project was a semester project where we went through a alot of different methods to build webpages(webapps). This one is made with Parcel.js. When you build with parcel you'll get a better a idea of how webpages work , cause you "go under the hood" of a bundler. Although webpack is the most common one, parcel bundles together in a smiliar way.

- Used Parcel.js for bundling sass, html and javascript files.
- Used Adobe illustrator for for custom design elements.
- Used netlify to deploy the webpage.
